<h1>ELEPHANTS</h1>

<p><br>Elephants show grief, mourning, and death awareness

Elephants return to the bones of dead herd members, gently touching skulls and tusks. They show reduced appetite and social withdrawal after a loss—patterns strikingly similar to human grief responses.
This suggests emotional memory and possibly a concept of death, not just reaction.</br></p>

<h1>DOLPHINS</h1>

<p>Mirror self-recognition is considered a marker of self-awareness. Dolphins inspect marked areas on their bodies when seeing their reflection.
Only a few species pass this test: dolphins, elephants, great apes, magpies, and humans.
This suggests a sense of self as an object, not just stimulus-response behavior.</p>
