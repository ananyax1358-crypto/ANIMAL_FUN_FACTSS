<h1>GREENLAND SHARKS</h1>
<img src="sh.jpeg" width=150 align="left">
<p> Greenland sharks may live 250–400 years — and it changes how their mind works

Greenland sharks grow and age so slowly that their brains develop over centuries.
Psychology implication: their perception of time, learning, and stress is radically different from fast-lived animals. A threat or stimulus that feels “urgent” to humans may register as almost insignificant to them.

Researchers believe this extreme longevity likely comes with:

<br>Very slow emotional reactivity</br>

<br>Minimal stress response</br>

<br>Long-term memory without urgency</br></p>

<h1>AXOLOTLS</h1>
<img src="ax.jpeg" width=150 align="right">
<p> Axolotls don’t just regenerate limbs — they may not experience trauma the same way

Axolotls can regenerate their brain tissue, spinal cord, and even parts of the heart without forming scar tissue.

Psychology / neuroscience angle:
In humans, trauma is partly “locked in” by neural scarring and rigid memory pathways. Axolotls, however, can rebuild neural circuits almost perfectly, suggesting:

Minimal long-term fear conditioning

No permanent trauma encoding

A nervous system biased toward reset rather than rumination

This makes them a major model organism for studying:

PTSD prevention

Neural plasticity

Memory rewriting</p>
